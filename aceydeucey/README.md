# Acey Deucey

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acey_Deucey_(card_game)

In this game the dealer will draw three playing cards.
Two of these cards are revealed to the player.
The player bets on whether they think the rank of the third card is between those two.

There are many variations to betting, deck management, and the number of players.
In this version we're going to do the bare minimum. This will provide a starting point
for you to develop into a more sophisticated version.
