# Basic Rust Games

The first computer book to sell a million copies was a collection of games
published in the 1970s. The programs were originally for early minicomputers
such as the PDP-8. Then the microcomputer revolution started with the Altair
8800. Soon we saw computers from Apple, Tandy, TI, Sinclair, BBC, Atari,
Commodore, and more. All these new computers came with the BASIC programming
language.

Millions of people learned to program with 101 BASIC Computer Games,
BASIC Computer Games and More BASIC Computer Games. This collection of
Rust games is a tribute to that era. It is also be a practical way to begin
learning computer science, or the Rust language.

All of these games are console games. No mouse. No graphics. No distractions.
